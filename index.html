      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Welcome to my MySpace page. I hold a B.A. in Liberal Studies and am a grad school dropout. This is my last attempt to make myself marketable in a capitalist society (little joke, there it goes...) Actually, I consider myself to be a lifelong student. I enrolled in the coding bootcamp at UCI to expand on my own bank of knowledge and skills in hopes that I will find a career that will calm the existential crisis that has plagued my late twenties. It's a pleasure to get to know others with a similar idea. </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I'm from the armpit of CA, the Central Valley.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I love to go on adventures. My favorite pasttime is to buy a last minute ticket and travel. I love going to music festivals and concerts. The outdoors keep me super busy. Hiking, camping, running are all things I adore. However, I could be equally as lazy and stay home to read, watch horror movies, game, journal, align my chakras, you know, all the things TikTok says are trending. </p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream job would be one where I wouldn't have to go to make a living. It'd most likely be starting an animal shelter on a farm and taking in as many animals as I can. Since at this point that is not possible, a job in tech would quench my thirst for all things challenging.I have always had a natural interest in technology. As a young child I tinkered with my parents old devices so much that they bought me an expensive and very unnecessary PC at the age of 5 so that I could explore it. Now, unfortunately for my own bank account, I try to get the newest tech that seems worthy enough to add to my daily life- it all seems worthy to me D:. Had I had enough talent, I would have been smart and created a YouTube channel to make some money off of reviewing all the tech I buy, but I digress. Coding would be perfect to open my world up to a new side of tech I had not looked too much into before and I am excited to seize the opportunity! </p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I am still living in the Central Valley. I have always said I would stay here but my life has changed so much in the last couple of years that that mentality is long gone. Now, I would like to pursue a career/lifestyle that would allow for remote work so that I can move about and travel to really experience what the world. I think this course would be a baby step towards reaching that goal. </p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I looked into web developing as it checked the boxes for almost, if not, all the boxes in an enjoyable career choice for me. I mentioned how I love challenges and adventure. I tend to get bored easily of repetitive tasks especially ones where the problem and solution are fairly simple or can be learned with little to no effort. Previous to the disaster that was quarantine, I was a Special Education teacher. The students ALWAYS kept me on my toes, however contrary to popular belief, being a teacher meant a lot more than just being with the students, specifically in special education. It was long hours, legal paperwork, 2-3 hour IEP meetings, many tasks to be done OUTSIDE of our contracted time. Because it was 65% geared towards these mundane tasks and only 40% of my effort was towards my students, I felt unmotivated. Web developing so far seems to keep me focused, even in the prework, which I usually find to be tedious in other settings. In most modules I have found a little obstacle that has completely thrown me for a loop, but has been fun to figure out. From speaking to friends who are also in the field this is a frequent occurrence. I am hopeful that SWE industry will keep me motivated and hungry for me!  </p>
